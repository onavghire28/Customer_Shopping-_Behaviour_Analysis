# Customer_Shopping-_Behaviour_Analysis

## Project Title
**Banking Transactions Analysis using Excel, SQL, and Power BI**

---

## Problem Statement
Banks generate large volumes of transaction data through deposits, withdrawals, online transfers, and card payments across multiple customer segments. However, this data often remains underutilized due to the lack of integrated analysis and visualization. The absence of a centralized analytical system makes it difficult for banks to monitor transaction trends, understand customer behavior, identify high-value customers, and detect operational inefficiencies such as failed transactions.

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis using Excel, extract meaningful insights using SQL, and build an interactive Power BI dashboard to support data-driven decision-making in the banking domain.

---

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing banking transaction data to understand customer behavior, transaction trends, and operational performance. The analysis is performed using **Excel for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **SQL for structured querying and insights**, and **Power BI for interactive visualization**.  

The project helps convert raw banking data into meaningful, actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making in the banking domain.

---

##  Objectives
- To analyze customer behavior based on transaction volume, frequency, and value.
- To identify high-value and low-engagement customers for strategic decision-making.
- To analyze failed transactions and identify operational bottlenecks.
- To analyze failed transactions and identify operational bottlenecks.


---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA  
- **SQL** – Data analysis using joins, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions  
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation  

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of banking-related data stored in CSV format, including:
- **Customer details** (demographics and account information)
- **Transaction data** (deposits, withdrawals, online transfers, card payments)
- **Loan data** (loan amount, EMI, loan status)

---

## Methodology
- Collect banking-related customer, transaction, and loan data was collected in
CSV format representing real-world banking operations.
- Excel was used to handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize formats,
and create derived columns for analysis.
- Pivot tables and charts in Excel were used to identify transaction trends, cus
tomer behavior, and channel-wise patterns.
- Cleaned data was imported into a relational database, and tables were created
with appropriate relationships and constraints.
- SQL queries involving joins, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions were used
to extract insights and perform advanced analysis.
- Relationships between tables were defined and calculated measures were created
to support analytical reporting.
- Interactive dashboards were built to visualize KPIs, transaction trends, customer
segmentation, and channel performance.
- Dashboard outputs were analyzed to derive actionable insights for improving
banking operations and customer experience.

---

## Key Insights
- Total successful transaction amount is approximately **116.26M**.
- **ATM** is the most used transaction channel, contributing over **25.47%** of transactions.
- **Withdrawals** are the highest transaction type by count.
- Adult males and senior females contribute the highest transaction amounts.
- **Chennai** records the highest number of transactions.
- Failed transactions are highest in the ATM channel due to network issues.
- Around **49%** of transactions are digital.
- Online transfers show a consistent growth trend.
- Total loan amount is **310.76M** with an average EMI of **23.66K**.

## Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Overall banking transaction summary
- Channel-wise transaction distribution
- Monthly transaction growth trends
- Customer segmentation and loan analysis

Interactive visuals help stakeholders quickly understand patterns and performance.
