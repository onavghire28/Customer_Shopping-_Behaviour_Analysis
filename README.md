# Customer_Shopping-_Behaviour_Analysis

## Project Title
**Customer_Shopping_Behaviour_Analysis (Excel | Python | Power BI)**

---

## Problem Statement
Despite having a high volume of daily sales, the business struggles to understand which products drive profit, how customer demographics affect sales, and what 
factors lead to sales fluctuations. This project aims to analyze shopping sales data to uncover actionable insights that can improve marketing strategies, inventory planning, and overall business performance.

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing shopping sales data to identify key business insights that can help improve sales performance and customer satisfaction. Basic data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using Excel to handle missing values, correct data formats, and prepare the dataset for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand sales patterns, product performance, customer preferences, and size-wise demand. Power BI was used to build interactive dashboards that visually highlight sales trends, best-selling categories, customer activity patterns, and payment behaviors. 

The study provides clear insights into category-wise performance, customer demographics, and operational metrics, enabling data-driven recommendations for enhancing product strategies, inventory planning, and customer experience.

## Recommendations
- Promote high-selling clothing SKUs: Increase stock and marketing for top performing clothing items to capture demand and avoid stockouts. 
- Target male customer segment: Tailor promotions and email campaigns to the more active male shoppers, while creating specific strategies to increase female engagement. 
- Revise outerwear assortment: Review pricing and styles for outerwear; consider discounts or bundling to boost demand. 
- Optimize size inventory: Stock more of size M and reduce overstock of S and XL; use size-level demand forecasting to balance inventory. 
- Leverage free shipping: Highlight free-shipping thresholds in marketing to increase average order value (AOV). 
- Monitor payment mix: Since payment modes contribute similar shares, ensure frictionless checkout across all modes and monitor for fraud/anomaly.
